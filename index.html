      <p>
        I’m Emmanuel Eshun from Accra, Ghana. As a student of Web Development and Design at BYU-Idaho, I’m building technical skills to create digital solutions that are functional, accessible, and purpose-driven.
        I serve as a teacher, leader, and secretary of the AAA Children’s Ministry and produce faith-inspired content on platforms like WhatsApp (“Journey with EL”) and LinkedIn—using technology to share hope, truth, and Christlike values.

      <h2>Ghana: Culture, Faith & Innovation</h2>

      <p>
        Ghana—known as the “Gateway to Africa”—is a nation rich in history, vibrant culture, and deep-rooted faith. It was the first sub-Saharan African country to gain independence in 1957 and is celebrated for its hospitality, democratic stability, and educational legacy.
        From the rhythms of highlife music to the innovation of mobile fintech like MTN Mobile Money, Ghana blends tradition with progress. Inspired by values like service and integrity (Ephesians 6:7–8), I aim to contribute to this legacy through ethical, impactful software development.
